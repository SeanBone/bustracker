# bustracker
Lightweight web app to log events during a bus ride. This information is useful to determine where buses are accumulating delays (e.g. intersections, selling tickets, traffic lights, etc).

 - Input a bus line name or number (or don't).
 - When clicking one of the coloured buttons, the corresponding event is registered with a time stamp and GPS coordinates.
 - Any text in the comment field will be attached to the next logged event.
 - You can download the logged data as a CSV file for analysis.

This app was developed as a commission for the civil engineering company [Comal](https://www.comal.ch/).

A live version can be found at [bustracker.seanbone.ch](http://bustracker.seanbone.ch/), although currently GPS won't work due to https not being enabled on that domain.
